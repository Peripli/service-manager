# Contribution Process

If you would like to discuss an issue before starting to work on it, do not hesitate to contact us on our [slack channel](https://openservicebrokerapi.slack.com/messages/C99PBB6ER). This would help avoid duplication of effort in case someone else has already started working on the issue.

:warning: Ensure that your modifications pass the lint checks, formatting checks, static code checks, and all other tests. Before you start working on your issue, please read our [Code Standards](code-standards.md) document.

:warning: When creating a PR, make sure to include all relevant details outlined in the [PR template](./../../PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Familiarize yourself with the [Contribution Guide](./../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
