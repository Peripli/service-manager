## Peripli/service-broker-proxy

This repository provides a framework for writing Service Manager Service Broker Proxies. It contains:

* the whole logic for the server, logging, graceful shutdown, configuration loading (from env, pflags, config files), etc...

* OSB API that takes care of proxying OSB calls from the Platform in which the proxy runs to the Service Manager

* state reconcilation job - provides logic for reconcilation of the state of service brokers and service access between the Service Manager (desired state) and platform (current state).

* interfaces that the `Peripli/service-broker-proxy-cf` and `Peripli/service-broker-proxy-k8s` implement in order to talk to the  corresponding platform controller during state reconcilation.

necessary interfaces in order to work with service brokers and service access.

## Peripli/service-broker-proxy-k8s

This repository contains a K8S specific implementation of the `Peripli/service-broker-proxy`. It reuses the proxy framework and implements the necessary interfaces in order to work with service brokers.

## Peripli/service-manager-cli

This repository contains the implementation for the Service Manager CLI `smctl`.
