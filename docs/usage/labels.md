# Resource labeling and querying

Specific resources in the Service Manager can be labeled in order to be organized into groups relevant to the users. Afterwards, resources can be queried either by the labels attached to them, or by the fields they have.

# Labels
Labels are key/value* pairs that can be associated with a resource in the Service Manager.  

They can be attached to a resource at creation time and added or modified at any time later on. Each key must be unique for a given resource. Each value must be unique for a given key.

```json
{
    ...
    "labels": {
        "key1": ["value1", "value2"],
        "key2": ["value3", "value4"]
    }
}
```

```
* A value in a label represents an array of strings.
```

## Syntax

Valid labels consist of a key and one or more values.  
Keys can contain all characters **except** the query separator (**|**) and the new-line character (**\n**).  
Values can contain all characters **except** the new-line character (**\n**). If any value contains the query separator (**|**), then this symbol must be escaped with a backslash (**\\**) - `This is a value with a \| separator`  
The length of both the key and each value must be between 1 and 255 characters.

## Management

The Service Manager conforms to the [API](#api) as to how labels are managed. 

Labels can be attached to or detached from a resource by `PATCH`-ing the resource with a [label change object](https://github.com/Peripli/specification/blob/visibility-labels/api.md#label-change-object).

# Querying

Querying can be performed both on labels and resource fields.
A valid query consist one or more criteria and a criterion consists of a left operand, an operator and a right operand.

The syntax is described below (note that **|** is a query separator and **||** is a separator for multiple values): 
```
<query-syntax>              ::= <criterion> OR <criterion> "|" <query-syntax>
<criterion>                 ::= KEY [ <multivariate-criterion> OR <univariate-criterion> ]
<multivariate-criterion>    ::= <empty-list> OR <multivariate-operator> <multiple-values>
<empyt-list>                ::= "[]"
<multivariate-operator>     ::= "in" OR "notin"
<multiple-values>           ::= "[" <values> "]"
<values>                    ::= VALUE OR VALUE "||" <values>
<univariate-criterion>      ::= ["=" OR "!=" OR "eqornil" OR "lt" OR "gt"] VALUE

KEY is a sequence of characters with length from 1 to 255 characters, not containing a query separator and new lines.
VALUE is a sequence of characters with length from 1 to 255 characters.  
The new line character (\n) must not be present.  
The query separator character (|) must be escaped with a backslash (\) if it is present.
For array values, the separator between the values in the array is ||.  
Delimiter between the operator and its operands is exactly one whitespace: ' '
Example:
x in [val1||val2]|y = 5|z eqornil value with \| separator
```

## Operators

* Equals (**=**):
    - Checks whether the left operand's value and the right operand are equal
    - Example: `platform_id = my_platform_id`
* Not equals (**!=**):
    - Checks whether the left operand's value and the right operand are not equal
    - Example: `platform_id != my_platform_id`
* Equals or nil (**eqornil**)
    - Checks whether the left operand's value is equal to the right operand OR the left operand's value is NULL
    - Example: `platform_id eqornil my_platform_id`
* Greater than (**gt**):
    - Checks whether the left operand's value is greater than the right operand. Supports only numerical values.
    - Example: `id gt 5`
* Less than (**lt**)
    - Checks whether the left operand's value is less than the right operand. Supports only numerical values.
    - Example: `id lt 5`
* In (**in**)
    - Checks whether the left operand's value is contained in the right operand. Works only for list values of the right operand contained in square braces.
    - Example: `id in [5|6|7]`
* Not in (**notin**)
    - Checks whether the left operand's value is NOT contained in the right operand. Works only for list values of the right operand contained in square braces.
    - Example: `id notin [1|2|3]`

## Query Types

Queries let you select resources based on the value of either the resource fields or the labels attached to the resource (or both).

* Field Query  
A field query is a query that is performed on the fields of the object.  
Example: The `visibility` object has the field `platform_id` so one might say `Give me all visibilities for a platform with id 038001bc-80bd-4d67-bf3a-956e4d545e3c`. This translates to `GET /visibilities?fieldQuery=platform_id = 038001bc-80bd-4d67-bf3a-956e4d545e3c`

* Label Query  
A label query is a query that is performed on the labels associated with the object.
Example: You might label multiple visibilities with the label `test = true` saying that this is test data. So getting all non-test visibilities (these are the ones that either have `test = false` or they don't have a `test` label) would translate to `GET /visibilities?labelQuery=test eqornil false`

* Mixed Query  
A mixed query is a query that is performed both on fields and labels.  
Example: `Give me all non-test visibilities for platform with id 038001bc-80bd-4d67-bf3a-956e4d545e3c.` This would translate to `/visibilities?fieldQuery=platform_id = 038001bc-80bd-4d67-bf3a-956e4d545e3c&labelQuery=test eqornil false`

# Supported resources

Service Manager supports `field querying` for all, where each resource might define which of its fields can be queried.

Service Manager supports `label querying` for the following resources:
* service broker
* visibility
