## Our Development Process
We use GitHub to maintain and version code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as review and accept pull requests.

## Proposing changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the project (we use [Github Flow][1]). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. Make sure to cover at least 80% of newly added code.
3. If your proposal involves changes to some APIs, don't forget to update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Propose your pull request.

Make sure the description of your Pull Request complies with the [template we've provided][6]!
